    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>Here is a list of my favorite hobbies.</p>

    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>I love to draw. Here is a list of things I like to draw:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dragons.</strong> I love to draw fire-breathing dragons.</li>
        <li><strong>People.</strong> Learning human anatomy and putting what I learn about it on paper is fun.</li>
        <li><strong>Trees and nature.</strong> <em>Any</em> kind of plant, bird, or tree is fun to draw.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>I like to cook, too. Here are some things that I like to prepare in the kitchen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Breakfast food.</strong> I like to fry some eggs.</li>
        <li><strong>Mexican pita with beef.</strong> I really like mexican food. There is one pita recipe which is a favorite of mine.</li>
        <li><strong>French Toast.</strong> Mmm. So good!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How to cook up some eggs.</h2>
    <p>Here's how you cook a perfect sunny-side up:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a small skillet and heat it up, <em>medium-high</em> heat.</li>
        <li>Pull out a tray of eggs.</li>
        <li>Once your pan is <strong>hot</strong>, sprinkle it with some <em>olive oil.</em></li>
        <li>Have a trash can prepared next to where you are standing. You want it to be close to your stove.</li>
        <li>Take out as many eggs as you like, frying <em>one egg</em> at a time.</li>
        <li>Crack an egg, slide it into the pan and drop the shells carefully into the trash can </li>
        <li>Rip a sheet of <strong>foil</strong> about the size of your pan. Place it over the pan.</li>
        <li>Check the egg frequently. About halfway through frying, add <strong>water</strong> to your egg.</li>
        <li>Be sure to add <em>salt</em> to your egg just before it finishes frying.</li>
        <li>Once your egg is completly fried, you are ready to eat.</li>
    </ol>
